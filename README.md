# Exploring Weather Trends

This is Project #1 from Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree. In this project, we analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in Cairo, Egypt to the global temperature trends.

The implementation details, including the used SQL queries, the generated graph, and the observations made during the analysis of our data can be found in the Weather Trends.pdf file. The extracted dataset can be found in the results.xlsx spreadsheet.
